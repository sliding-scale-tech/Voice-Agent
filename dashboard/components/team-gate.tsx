/**
 * Explains a team-less dashboard instead of quietly rendering an empty one.
 *
 * Every org-scoped query degrades to nothing when the signed-in account has no team, which
 * looks identical to a brand-new install — that is exactly how an invitee who signed up but
 * never redeemed their invite reads the screen. If an invitation is waiting for their address,
 * this offers it directly, so the join no longer depends on them finding the original email.
